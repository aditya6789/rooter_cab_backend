# Socket Handlers Refactoring

## Overview

This project has undergone significant refactoring of its socket handling code to improve maintainability, reduce duplication, and fix potential issues.

## Key Changes

1. **Centralized Socket Handlers**: All socket event handlers have been moved to a dedicated file `services/socketHandlers.ts` that provides a clear, centralized location for all socket-related functionality.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Each socket event handler now includes proper error handling and appropriate client feedback.

3. **Simplified Controller Logic**: The `rideController.ts` file has been dramatically simplified by removing socket-specific code, making it more focused on HTTP request handling.

4. **Cleaner Server Setup**: The `index.ts` file now has a much cleaner setup with a single call to initialize all socket handlers.

5. **Utility Functions**: Common utility functions like `generateOTP` have been moved to a dedicated helpers file.

## Implementation Details

### Socket Handlers (`services/socketHandlers.ts`)

This new file contains all socket-related functionality:
- Connection handling
- Customer and driver registration
- Location updates
- Ride request handling
- OTP verification
- Ride completion and cancellation
- Disconnect handling

### Ride Controller Changes

The ride controller now focuses on:
- HTTP API endpoints
- Database operations
- Business logic

It still interfaces with the socket layer but without directly managing socket connections.

### Server Initialization

The server initialization in `index.ts` now uses a single function call to set up all socket handlers:

```typescript
// Set up centralized socket handlers
setupSocketHandlers(io);
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Code is now organized by responsibility, making it easier to maintain.
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Common patterns are now centralized.
3. **Reliability**: Consistent error handling throughout socket interactions.
4. **Scalability**: New socket events can be added without cluttering the main server file.
5. **Testability**: Socket handlers can be tested independently of HTTP controllers.

## Future Improvements

1. Further refactor socket handlers into domain-specific modules
2. Add comprehensive logging
3. Implement reconnection strategies
4. Add more validation for socket events
